grandparentage inference </br>
</br> </br> 
Inference of grandparentage based on genetic markers, namely SNPs and microhaplotypes </br>
Potentially some other relationships as well, but main goal is grandparentage </br>
Current options: </br>
* "single-sided" grandparentage: a trio of grandchild + both maternal grandparents (or both paternal grandparents) </br>
* single parentage: a pair of parent + offspring </br>
