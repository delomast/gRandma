Inference of grandparentage based on genetic markers, namely SNPs and microhaplotypes
Potentailly some other relationships as well, but main function is grandparentage
Current options:
  "single-sided" grandparentage: a trio of grandchild + both maternal grandparents (or both paternal grandparents)
